	<h1>Did You Know?</h1>

	<p><span id = "red">Did You Know? </span>
	An HTML &lt;form&gt; tag can specify <strong>any</strong> file with the <strong>action</strong> attribute, not just .php files.
	</p>

	<p><span id = "green">Did You Know? </span>
	Every PHP instruction ends in a semi-colon.
	</p>

	<p><span id = "orange">Did You Know? </span>
	.php files can include HTML. In fact a .php can be all HTML with NO PHP (like this one).
	</p>

	<p><span id = "blue">Did You Know? </span>
	You can run a .php file directly by simply typing in the URL in the Browser window instead of using the Submit button of a Web form. However if the .php file expected to receive user input from a form you may get unexpected results!
	</p>

	<p><span id = "pink">Did You Know? </span>
	Submit buttons can have any message.
	</p>

	<p><span id = "magenta">Did You Know? </span>
	A Web page can include many forms. This means that a user can submit different requests from a single Web page simply by choosing which Submit button to press.
	</p>

	<p><span id = "cyan">Did You Know? </span>
	If you View Source of a .php file you just see HTML code. Do you know why?
	</p>

	<p><a href = "did-you-know.html">Return to the Did You Know form</a></p>
