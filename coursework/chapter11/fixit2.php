	Purpose:  What's wrong here? The carsSold array is supposed to store 
		four values, containing the cars sold for each quarter of the year. 
		But when you run the program, there is a syntax error! 
		Are we using the right syntax?
		NOTE: you may need to MODIFY the statement $carsSold = array [175, 320, 270, 390];
		but do not REPLACE this statement.
