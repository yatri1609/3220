	Purpose:  What's wrong here? The getWage() function is
			  supposed to calculate overtime (time and a half) for
			  any hours worked above 40. The function is working
			  just fine but when we send the $hoursWorked
			  and $hourlyWage from THIS program the function does
			  not calculate the overtime as time and a half!
			  Can you fix it? The wage should be $605.63 not $573.75
