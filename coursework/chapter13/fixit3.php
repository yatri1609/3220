	Purpose:  What's wrong here? The getWage() and getBonus()
			  functions are provided in a file named
			  inc-wage-functions.php. This program uses the getWage()
			  function just fine but the call to the getBonus()
			  function isn't returning the correct bonus. It should
			  be 75.00 not 50.00. Can you fix it?
