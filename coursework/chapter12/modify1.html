	Purpose:Chapter 12 Exercise

	This applications displays a table containing a game player's name,
	game character, and score. Modify this code so that it first creates
	an associative array named $playerInfo and stores the values "Christine",
	"Wizard", and 345 into elements named 'name', 'character', and 'score'.

	Now modify the print statement so that it uses the $playerInfo array to 
	obtain the values for the second column of each row.

	modify1.html does not need to be changed.
