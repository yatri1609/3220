	Purpose:Chapter 6 Exercise

	REQUIREMENT: Write a Web-based application consisting of a Web form
	(modify1.html) and a PHP program (modify1.php).

	modify1.html includes a form that prompts the user for a country and
	the capital city of that country. When this is submitted, modify1.php
	receives the two inputs and writes this to a file named capitals.txt
	Run the program a few times, each time entering a different country
	and capital. After each each submission, open capitals.txt to see that
	the file has been changed. Note the previous content of the file is
	lost each time new input is submitted. That's because the file is opened
	for write operations.

	Now modify modify1.php so that the  file is opened for append
	operations instead of write operations. Run the program a few times,
	each time entering a different country and capital. After each each
	submission, open capitals.txt to see that the file has been changed.
	Note that now each new submission is added to the existing file.
