	Purpose:  What's wrong here? This program is supposed to open a
			  file for reading, read three wage amounts from the file,
			  close the file, calculate the total and average, and display
			  the three wages, total and average. But when the program
			  runs, error messages are generated for lines 24 - 26.
			  Hint: each of the lines is associated with accessing the
			  text file that we opened in line 23, which file is that?
